# Conviction v2.0 - Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Successfully Implemented Features

### âœ… **1. GDP Budgeting Mechanism**
- **Income Generation**: Blocs earn GDP tokens based on territories, economic development, and cohesion
- **Budget Allocation**: Players allocate GDP across 5 categories: Military, Technology, Culture, Infrastructure, Diplomacy
- **Spending Effects**: Each category provides specific benefits when budgets are spent
- **Economic Development**: Infrastructure spending can improve GDP generation multipliers

### âœ… **2. Cards & Counters (Rock-Paper-Scissors)**
- **10 Policy Cards**: Each with unique effects and specific counters
  - **Aggressive**: CYBER_ESPIONAGE, TARIFF_HIKE, PROXY_ARMS, STANDARDS_PUSH, DISINFORMATION
  - **Defensive**: COUNTER_INTEL, TRADE_DEAL, AID_RECONSTRUCTION, LOBBYING_BLITZ, CONTENT_MODERATION
- **Counter Mechanics**: Each card has a specific counter, creating strategic depth
- **Pairwise Resolution**: Cards are resolved between all bloc pairs with detailed effect application

### âœ… **3. Random Event Deck**
- **12 Regional Events**: Affect individual blocs with varied consequences
- **3 Global Events**: Affect all blocs simultaneously
- **Dynamic Effects**: Events modify bloc attributes, GDP, alliances, and more
- **Event Probability**: 60% chance per bloc for regional events, 20% for global events

### âœ… **4. Retired Old AI Integration Ladder**
- **Removed**: `_resolve_ai_orders()` method and manual AI advancement
- **Integrated**: AI/Tech advancement now handled through budget allocation in Technology category
- **Streamlined**: Simplified order processing and removed obsolete AI integration prompts

### âœ… **5. Clean, Formatted Codebase**
- **Formatted**: All Python files with Black formatter
- **Linted**: Code checked and fixed with Ruff
- **Optimized**: Removed unused variables and imports with autoflake
- **Modular Structure**: Clean separation between models, game logic, and events

## File Structure

## Game Flow

### **Four-Phase Turn Structure:**

1. **BACK_CHANNEL**: Private negotiations and alliance discussions
2. **POLICY_DRAFT**: 
   - Generate GDP income based on territories and development
   - Allocate GDP budget across 5 domains
   - Select one policy card for the turn
3. **RESOLUTION**:
   - Apply budget spending effects
   - Resolve card battles (rock-paper-scissors mechanics)
   - Process any remaining orders
4. **HEADLINE_NEWS**:
   - Random events affect blocs (60% chance each)
   - Global events affect all blocs (20% chance)

### **Victory Conditions:**
- **Goal**: Reach 50 Victory Points
- **VP Sources**: GDP tokens, tech levels, military posture, cultural influence, cohesion, satellites, alliances
- **VP Penalties**: Effective regulatory drag

## Key Improvements

### **Strategic Depth**
- **Resource Management**: GDP budgeting requires careful allocation
- **Tactical Decisions**: Card selection with counter mechanics
- **Risk vs Reward**: Events provide uncertainty and adaptation opportunities

### **Player Agency**
- **Economic Strategy**: Multiple paths to victory through different budget priorities
- **Diplomatic Play**: Card counters encourage predicting opponent moves
- **Adaptive Planning**: Random events require flexible strategies

### **Balanced Progression**
- **Meaningful Choices**: Every GDP token allocation matters
- **Tech Advancement**: Now requires sustained investment rather than lucky rolls
- **Economic Development**: Infrastructure investment provides long-term benefits

## Testing Verified âœ…

All systems have been tested and verified working:
- Game initialization and basic mechanics
- GDP income generation and budget allocation
- Budget spending effects and attribute changes
- Card selection and battle resolution
- Event system (both regional and global)
- Victory point calculation and win conditions
- Bot player integration
- Turn phase progression

## Ready for Play! ðŸŽ®

Conviction v2.0 is now a complete, balanced strategy game with meaningful economic decisions, tactical card play, and dynamic events. The infinite loop issue has been resolved with the new GDP budgeting system providing clear progression paths to victory.
